# Data Science Portfolio

This is a collection of projects that were done as part of the [integrated Data
Science MSc/PhD](https://datacdt.org) that
I did at the University of Liverpool. I received a Distinction for the MSc, but dropped out of the PhD without completing to work with data-driven start-ups.
